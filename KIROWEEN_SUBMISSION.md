## Why This Matters

The early web was a place of unbridled creativity where anyone could make a homepage that expressed their personality. Corporate web design has optimized that creativity away.

RetroWeb brings back that spirit while making it accessible with modern tools:
- AI helps you create without needing to code
- Chrome extension lets you experience retro web anywhere
- Open source means anyone can contribute and remix

We're not just resurrecting old technology - we're showing that the values of the early web (creativity, personality, fun) are still relevant and needed today.
